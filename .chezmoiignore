We check the workstation variable in the config file
(~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.yaml).
If the 'workstation' variable is not found, if it is set to false,
or if the config file doesn't exist, then we write '.workstation'
in the ignore file.
Therefore, to have the .workstation dotfile deployed on a 
workstation, create the file '~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.yaml' with 
the following content:
data:
  workstation: true
