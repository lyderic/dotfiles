{{/*
We check the workstation variable in the config file
(~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.yaml).
If the 'workstation' variable is not found, if it is set to false,
or if the config file doesn't exist, then we write the files that
go only on a workstation (~/.workstation, ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf,
etc.) to the ignore file.
Therefore, to have the .workstation dotfile deployed on a 
workstation, create the file '~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.yaml' with 
the following content:
data:
  workstation: true
that allow it will have it.
