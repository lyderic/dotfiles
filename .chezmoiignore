1. We check that the config file exist at all.
2. Then we check if there is a workstation variable and if
   it set to true
If the 'workstation' variable is not found or set to false,
then we write '.workstation' in the ignore file.
So, to have this file deployed on a workstation,
create the file '~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.yaml' with 
the following content:
data:
  workstation: true
