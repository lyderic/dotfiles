{{/*
The following files are only to be deployed on workstations:
- ~/.workstation (encrypted)
- ~/.ssh/config (encrypted)
- ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf (template)
- ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
To achieve this, we set up gpg encryption on the host workstation
machine.
If 'encryption' is not set as 'gpg and the 'gpg' > 'recipient'
variable is not found, (or if the config file doesn't exist), then we
write these following files, i.e. they are NOT ignored.
Therefore, to have these dotfiles deployed on a workstation,
create the file '~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.yaml' with the
following content:
-----8<-----
encryption: gpg
gpg:
  recipient: "XXXXXXXX"
----->8-----
