{{/*
Some files are only to be deployed on workstations.
To achieve this, we define the host machine as 'workstation: true'.
Moreover, on workstations, we need a master gpg key in order to
decrypt the encrypted_* files.
If the 'data' > 'workstation' variable is not found, if it is set to
'false', or if the config file doesn't exist, then we write the
following files (i.e. they are NOT ignored):
- ~/.workstation (encrypted)
- ~/.ssh/config (encrypted)
- ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
- ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
Therefore, to have these dotfiles deployed on a workstation,
create the file '~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.yaml' with the
following content:
-----8<-----
data:
  workstation: true
encryption: gpg
gpg:
  recipient: "XXXXXXXX"
----->8-----
